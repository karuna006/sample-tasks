Subject: Salary Adjustment Query

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am reaching out to discuss the recent salary adjustment I received in September 2023.

As you may recall, my journey with [Company Name] commenced in March 2022, and I have remained dedicated to contributing my best to the company's objectives. The acknowledgment of my efforts through the salary increase in September was genuinely appreciated.

However, upon reviewing the details, I noticed that the salary adjustment only covered the period from September 2023 onwards. This has led me to believe that there may be arrear amounts due for two distinct time frames: from March 2022 to August 2022 and from March 2023 to August 2023.

I kindly request your assistance in providing me with comprehensive information regarding these arrear amounts, along with the procedures involved in disbursing them. This clarity will not only enhance my understanding of my compensation but will also aid me in managing my finances more effectively.

If there are any additional documents or information necessary on my part to expedite this process, please do not hesitate to inform me. I am fully committed to ensuring that our financial records accurately reflect my contributions, thus upholding transparency and fiscal responsibility.

I sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter and anticipate that we can collaboratively resolve this issue promptly.

Warm regards,

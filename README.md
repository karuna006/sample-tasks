Subject: Inquiry About Arrear Amount for Salary Hike

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the arrear amount related to my recent salary hike, which I received in September 2023.

As you may recall, I joined [Company Name] in March 2022 and have been dedicatedly contributing to the team's goals ever since. I was delighted to receive the salary increase in September, and I sincerely appreciate the recognition of my efforts.

However, I have noticed that the salary hike included the adjustments only from September 2023 onwards. I believe there might be arrears for the period from my joining date in March 2022 up to August 2023 that require reconciliation. 

I kindly request you to please provide me with the details regarding the arrear amount and the process for disbursing it. This clarification will help me better understand my compensation and financial planning.

If there are any additional documents or information required from my end to expedite this process, please do not hesitate to let me know, and I will provide them promptly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to resolving this issue collaboratively.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
